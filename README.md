# Community Notes (.dev)

Community Notes by Kayle uses the principles of Twitterâ€˜s Community Notes
to provide a service to allow other communities and platforms to introduce 
a community notes feature.

## Notice

When starting this project, I forked my personal make next app boilerplate.

Due to licensing issues, I cannot share the repository for the boilerplate.

However, you can find the boilerplate in commits to this repository prior to `9966fda`.
Or, click [here](https://github.com/KayleAI/communitynotes/commit/9966fdaf02a14437ab3331d00859b8b09502959f) 
to view the commit that started the Community Notes project.
